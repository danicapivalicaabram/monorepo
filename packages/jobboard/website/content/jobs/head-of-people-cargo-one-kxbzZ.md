**Join us in changing an entire industry**

We need you to help us shape the future of air freight! At [cargo.one](http://cargo.one/) we believe that we can only win as a team, and we want you to make an impact with us!

**🏆 About the opportunity**

The People Team plays a crucial role in the worldwide success of [cargo.one](http://cargo.one); from attracting, hiring and retaining new cargonauts, the impact we have is far-reaching and hugely rewarding.  We care less about policies and procedures, and more about experiences and empowering our people to do their best work. Our goal is to have one of the best People Teams in Europe, heck, why not even the world?! Yes, we are ambitious but also realize where our limitations are. We are currently 40 cargonauts working virtually across Europe with ambitions to triple the team over the next few months. This requires us to evolve our remote operating system, scale our recruiting and onboarding capabilities, and fine-tune how we develop our people as we continue to grow across 3 continents.

To be successful with our mission, we're looking for an ambitious, forward-thinking Head of People to join us and serve as an expert on all people-related topics. Reporting to the Co-CEO, you will also lead a newly formed People Team including a Recruiting Partner (external agencies) and a People Ops. Manager. Your role will naturally have a broad reach internally across the entire organization as well as externally to drive employer branding initiatives that highlight the true essence of life at [cargo.one](http://cargo.one).

If this sounds like the opportunity you're ready for, we think you could be a great addition to the team.

*   Establish clear and actionable systems (reports, defined KPIs & metrics) that support our hiring, people & organization development and D&I goals
*   Drive people-focused initiatives across the company including regular team events (virtual and in-person), feedback cycles and pulse surveys that contribute and strengthen our culture
*   Design programs and trainings that support our people managers' development as [cargo.one](http://cargo.one) grows
*   Refine and evolve how we keep our employees up to date and informed on people-related topics and initiatives.

## 🙋🏻‍♀️ What you’ll need

*   You have already gained experience as Head of People, or above, in a high-growth tech company, scaling the organization outside of Europe leading multiple teams including recruiting, HR & L&D
*   A passion for developing and leading teams with a strong bias for action
*   Comfortable working on strategic topics with senior leaders and rolling up your sleeves to get things done
*   Experience having managed distributed teams either fully- or part-virtual
*   A data-informed mindset balanced with a human-centric touch
*   Pro-active in your approach to getting things done; you should be comfortable taking the initiative and making decisions that have the best interest of [cargo.one](http://cargo.one) at heart
