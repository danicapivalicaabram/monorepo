**In short:**

The infrastructure you will be building will power the future of online payments

A small team means a simpler decision-making process: we get to choose the tools and technologies we want to use!

You will be responsible for a globally distributed infrastructure. With great power comes great responsibility!

**The goals of the team:**

*   Continually keep an eye on our monitoring and alerting tools to ensure the health and well-being of our infrastructure. As a part of this, build dashboards to enable effective monitoring
*   Be part of an on-call rotation and debug production issues and outages across many levels and services within the live production environment
